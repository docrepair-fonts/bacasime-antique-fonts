    Bacasime Antique is a DocRepair font, intended to improve compliance with the
    ISO/IEC 29500 standard by providing fallback for Baskerville Old Face that minimizes text reflow in
    Office Open XML documents. Bacasime Antique is based on Playfair, which is
    stylistically a transitional design.
