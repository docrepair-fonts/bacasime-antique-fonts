# Bacasime Antique

Bacasime Antique is a DocRepair font, intended to improve compliance with the ISO/IEC
29500 standard by providing fallback that minimizes text reflow in Office Open
XML documents. Bacasime Antique is based on Playfair, which is stylistically a transÂ­itional design.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://docrepair-fonts.github.io/bacasime-antique-fonts.
